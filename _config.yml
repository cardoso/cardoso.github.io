 Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matheus Cardoso. I'm a Developer Advocate, Conference Speaker, and Technical Writer.

 I've worked at worldwide companies such as **[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat)**, **[Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com)** and **[Stream](https://getstream.io)**.

 I've been a recurring appearance at worldwide events such as **[AltConf](https://altconf.com)**, **[DeveloperWeek](https://developerweek.com)**, and **[Swift Heroes](https://swiftheroes.com)**. 

 I'm also a mentor and admin for **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)**, having attended summits held in Sunnyvale, California and in Munich, Germany.

 As a huge fan of Apple platforms, I've developed several libraries and applications written in **Swift** and **Objective-C**, and I've won the **WWDC Scholarship** prize.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
