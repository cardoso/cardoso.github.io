Hi, I am Matheus Cardoso! I'm a 22-year old developer and Open Source enthusiast based in Brazil. Today, I work remotely for [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat), an Open Source Self-Hosted alternative to Slack. 

Before working at Rocket.Chat, I was an Apple Developer Academy scholar for 2 years where I had the pleasure of being a WWDC Scholarship recipient.

I've been a recurring speaker at local events such as CocoaHeads and Pytalks, sharing knowledge and spreading the word about Open Source.
