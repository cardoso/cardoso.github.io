Hi, I am Matheus Cardoso! I'm a 22-year old developer and Open Source enthusiast based in Brazil. Today, I work remotely for [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat), an Open Source Self-Hosted alternative to Slack. 

Before working at Rocket.Chat, I was an Apple Developer Academy scholar for 2 years where I had the pleasure of being a WWDC Scholarship recipient.

I've been a speaker at international events such as AltConf 2018 and a recurring speaker at local and national events such as CocoaHeads, Pytalks and TDC, sharing knowledge and spreading the word about Open Source.

I'm also a mentor for Google Summer of Code, having attended the mentor summit in California.
