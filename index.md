Hi, I am Matheus Cardoso! I'm a 22-year old developer and Open Source enthusiast based in Brazil. Today, I work remotely for Rocket.Chat, an Open Source Self-Hosted alternative to Slack. (https://rocket.chat). 

Before working at Rocket.Chat, I was an Apple Developer Academy scholar for 2 years where I had the pleasure of being a WWDC Scholarship recipient.

I've been a recurring speaker at local events such as CocoaHeads and Pytalks, sharing knowledge and spreading the word about Open Source.
I have experience in many areas including:

* Game Development (VR, Desktop and Mobile)
* Native App Development (iPhone, iPad and Apple TV)
* Backend Development
