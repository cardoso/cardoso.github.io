Hi, I am Matheus Cardoso! I'm a developer and Open Source enthusiast based in Brazil.

Today, I work remotely for [Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com), helping developers and founders build secure end-to-end encrypted Apps that need to comply with HIPAA or GDPR.

Before Virgil, I worked for [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat), an Open Source Self-Hosted alternative to Slack. I was in charge of maintaining and developing new features for the iOS App in Swift and Objective-C, writing unit tests and managing Open Source contributions.

Before working at Rocket.Chat, I was an Apple Developer Academy scholar for 2 years where I had the pleasure of being a WWDC Scholarship recipient in 2017.

I've been a recurring speaker in international events such as AltConf in 2018 and 2019, and a recurring speaker at local and national events such as CocoaHeads, Pytalks and TDC, sharing knowledge and spreading the word about Open Source.

I was also a mentor for Google Summer of Code in 2018 and Admin in 2019, having attended the 2018 summit in Sunnyvale, California.
